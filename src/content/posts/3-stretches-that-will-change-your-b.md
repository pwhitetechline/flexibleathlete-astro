The Focused Flexibility Training system is rooted from the wisdom of Hatha Yoga stretches.

Out of the hundreds of stretches (Yoga poses) and variations you may be wondering how I could pick just a few stretches that can change your body.

Well the brilliant thing about stretching is that any stretch you choose has the potential to change your body and your mind!

If you find it challenging to stretch on a frequent basis try choosing just 3 stretches to practice daily.

Practicing just 3 stretches each day for a week gives you the opportunity to explore the many benefits and intricacies of the stretch. I chose these 3 stretches that will change your body!

Let’s choose 3!
