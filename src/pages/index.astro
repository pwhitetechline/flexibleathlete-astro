                <h3>Why is Julstro Muscular Therapy Sport Massage Different Than Massage?</h3>
                <div class="comparison-grid">
                    <div class="julstro">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Julstro Muscular Therapy is not a full-body relaxing massage. It is a unique sport massage that focuses on the specific spasms that are putting pressure on the joint and/or nerve.</li>
                            <li>Julstro Muscular Therapy is done through clothing without sliding on the skin, so oil is not necessary.</li>
                            <li>Treatment is not only done in Julie's office, but is also done at a sporting event, the office, or any public place appropriate for the client's activity.</li>
                            <li>Julstro Muscular Therapy eliminates the source of pain so the results are long-lasting or permanent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="regular">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Massage is basically general in nature. It increases your circulation and flushes toxins out of the surface muscle fibers.</li>
                            <li>Massage uses oil as a lubricant and can leave you feeling the need to take a shower.</li>
                            <li>Treatment must be done in an office or other private area.</li>
                            <li>Massage effects last for several hours.</li>
