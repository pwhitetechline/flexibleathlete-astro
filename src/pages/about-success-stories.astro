                    <p>"As an athlete, when I discovered Focused Flexibility Training I was impressed. I always dreaded stretching because it was so painful and my injuries were getting in the way. Focused Flexibility Training has allowed me to become more flexible. I could feel deep tensions resolving during the first session. This was the missing link with my workouts and in my body."</p>

                    <p>"I've tried them all…tennis balls, squash ball, golf ball, bean bags, bagged marbles, assorted types from sports stores, one from local therapy center…you name it, I probably tried it! None of them really were quite 'right'…either too hard, too soft, too large diameter or too small.</p>
                    <p>But the Trigger Point Therapy ball did the trick!!! After two self- sessions on my right hip (side) and lower back, the knots in my right hip were gone!! I can feel the ball "dig" into the hip joint with hard pressure and not bruise the muscles. I started out using the ball and bamboo stick 3-4 times a day and now down to maybe once a day to none!! Great relief…the pain which had me in tears is now gone. No more chiropractor trips!! The chiropractor said, 'the pain was in my head'…yeah right! Now I am studying the videos. Well worth the investment."</p>

                    <p>"Fifteen years ago I slipped on ice and landed on my tailbone. Ouch! My hips, gluteus, hamstrings and lower back were often achy and I found it hard to find relief. Over the past 15 years, I tried chiropractic, physical therapy, massage, working with a personal trainer, yoga (without trigger point release first), pilates, and many homeopathic remedies and nothing gave me long lasting relief. However, within 2 weeks of using the DVDs, I feel virtually no discomfort anymore! This is now part of my daily exercise routine. I am on a mission to share how effective it is with many more people!"</p>
